## 🔍 What I'm Into

- **App Development** – Learning how to build mobile and web apps using tools like Java and JavaScript. I enjoy figuring out how to make useful and clean interfaces.
- **Adversarial AI** – Helping create a hands-on course that teaches how AI models can be tricked by carefully designed inputs (called adversarial examples), and how to defend against that. We’re using Python. 
- **Coding for Practice** – I like solving problems with code, building small tools or mini projects, and trying to write clean, understandable programs.

## 📝 Projects (So Far)

- **Adversarial AI Course (In Progress)**  
  Helping design labs and examples that show how attacks and defenses work in real machine learning systems.

- **Mini App Projects**  
  Working on small apps like a to-do list or simple game to learn how frontends and mobile UIs work. Will post links here soon!

- **Scripts & Challenges**  
  Writing short Python or Java programs for fun or practice—like automation tools or code challenges.
